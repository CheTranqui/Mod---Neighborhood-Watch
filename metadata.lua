	'description', "This mod is designed to help you track colonists that you have declared to be VIPs.  It keeps track of these individuals and displays them, along with some of their basic information like dome and workplace, in sets of five, and allows you to zoom to them.  It also tracks and informs you when one of your VIPs dies, then stores some information about their passing for you to view later, should you choose.\r\n\r\nAll of this is only a part of the suite of mods that I am creating to allow you to engage more personally with your colonists.  I hope you enjoy it!  If you do, please remember to come back and leave a note on what you enjoyed most in the comments below!\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs Soon To Be Squashed:\r\n1.  Age of Death currently displays the oldest a colonist will become before dying and is only accurate if they've died of old age.\r\n2.  Sometimes the Age of a Potential VIP shows up as a variable instead of their actual age.  If you click on to \"View List of Current VIPs\", then close that window, this bug will be fixed for the time being.\r\n\r\nOther Mods that I Have Created:\r\n1.
